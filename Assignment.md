* <b>plot2.R</b>: A plot of the Global Active Power (kilowatts) over Time from the selected.txt file.

* <b>plot3.R</b>: A plot of the 3 Sub Metering data from the selected.txt file.

* <b>plot4.R</b>: A 2X2 matrix plot of 
	* The distribution of the Global Active Power (kilowatts) from the selected.txt file.
	* The distribution of Voltage over time from the selected.txt file.
	* Plot 3 as above
	* The distribution of Global Reactive Power over time from the selected.txt file.
